# Word and picture grid presentation

Service 96 uses a separate renderer from the dialogue panel and the service-71
timed word choices. This document describes the recovered Android 1.0.9 layout
in a **320 x 480**, top-left-origin viewport. Positions scale together when the
desktop window changes size. Rules and script records are in
[MINIGAMES.md](MINIGAMES.md#5-service-96-word-and-picture-grids).

Evidence is the locally inspected `libshs09.so`; addresses below use the same
Ghidra image base as the engine specification. No native code or original art
is included in this repository. All artwork, fonts, labels, episode text and
portraits are read from the player's imported content.

## Resource and font contracts

`000c6944` loads these paired CS fonts and atlases:

| Resources | Use | Native metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 510 / 511 | Orange-outlined word prompts and central banners | Height 52, tracking -6, line gap 0 |
| 512 / 513 | White italic headings, tutorial titles, time, score and score changes | Height 27, tracking -3, line gap 1 |
| 516 / 517 | White tutorial body | Height 16, tracking 1, line gap 0 |
| 522 / 523 | Blue tile letters | Height 85, tracking 0, line gap 1 |
| 446 | Tiles, arrows, cloud edges, haze and tutorial frame | Literal frames described below |
| 499 | Portrait ring | 148 x 152 |
| 502 | Cloud behind each portrait | 167 x 148 |
| 496 | Loaded portrait-related texture | 133 x 150; no active drawing reference established |

These are atlas glyphs, rather than substitutes from the dialogue's named
BMFonts or the operating system. The second byte of the metrics header,
previously named `style` by the parser, is a **signed line gap**: `000538ac` stores it at
font offset `+0x139`, and `00054490` adds it to each line's height. Horizontal
tracking is header byte 2. Width measurement omits the final tracking interval.

Wrapping uses glyph widths, backs up to a space when a word will not fit, and
splits an overlong word at the last fitting glyph. Leading spaces are discarded
on each line. Explicit newlines, including empty paragraph lines, count toward
height. An ending newline does not add a further empty line. Missing glyphs
use the original opposite-case lookup, then space advance. Evidence:
`00052f88`, `000534a8`, `000535fc`, `00053130`, `00054490`.

Time and score use the width of glyph `3` for all digits (`00053718`). Time is
rounded up to seconds and padded to three digits; score is padded to five.
Labels come from resource 13, entries 32 and 33. The target score appears in
the opening and result banners; there is no extra score/target row or round
progress bar beneath the board in the recovered renderer.

## Stable layout

| Element | Placement / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Background | Service argument, centered at (160, 240) |
| Rotating haze | Atlas 446 frame 3, centered at (160, 240), scale 1.8 |
| Cloud edges | Atlas 446: bottom 0 at y=429, top 4 at y=0, left 1 at x=0, right 2 at x=273; repeated and scrolled |
| Left NPC | For art size `(w,h)`, center `(w//2+10, h//2+17)` |
| Right character | Center `(310-w//2, 487-h//2)`; flip horizontally unless NPC property 651 is 3 |
| Portrait ring | Center 12px above the character center |
| Portrait cloud | Center 0.5px right and 2px above the character center |
| Time label | Right edge 196, top 2 |
| Time digits | Right edge 206, top 22 |
| Score label | Right edge 278, top 2 |
| Score digits | Right edge 310, top 22 |
| Heading lines | (110,60), (104,80), (95,100), at most three explicit lines |
| Settled word prompts | Scale .65, centers at y=377, 402, 427; left origins approximately x=15, 38, 61, subject to integer rounding |

Portraits retain their original size and transparency. The word game does not
use the dialogue's circular crop or place two enlarged characters along the
bottom. The native portrait circles can extend beyond the viewport; that
clipping is intentional. Evidence: `000c98c0`, `000cbb5c`, `000c6220`,
`000c1ca8`, `000c6ebc`, `000c39c0`, `000c5400`, `000c8790`.

The desktop pause gear remains available at the lower left. The provisional
full-width dialogue footer and duplicate instruction line are removed, so
they do not obscure the right portrait and bottom word list. That pause control
is a desktop accommodation; its placement is not evidence for a native grid
footer contract.

## Tutorial panel schema

For a tutorial record's `tutorial_text`, `tutorial_title` and
`tutorial_position`, `000c5da0` computes:

```text
column_width = 286
body_height = wrapped_text_height + 20
center_y = body_height / 2 + 30           when position == 0 (top)
         = 480 - (body_height / 2 + 30)   when position == 2 (bottom)
         = 240                          otherwise (center)

x = 160 - 153 * scale
top = center_y - (body_height + 23 + 15) * scale / 2
body_y = top + 23 * scale - 1
```

Draw atlas 446 frame 47 (306 x 23) at `(x,top)`, frame 45 (306 x 1)
stretched to the body height at `(x,body_y)`, and frame 46 (306 x 15) at
`(x,body_y+body_height*scale)`. The body text starts at
`(x+10*scale,body_y+10*scale)`; the title starts at
`(x+22*scale,top-6*scale)`. All pieces share the same scale and opacity.

This measures the entire paragraph rather than shrinking it to a fixed box.
For example, a 128px body text height produces a top panel from y=11 through
y=196, or a centered panel from y=147 through y=332. The panel is translucent
and draws over the other game elements, as in the native draw order.

The initial tutorial waits 3200ms, then grows/fades in over 500ms. Subsequent
pages enter over 500ms after the board transition. A completed page shrinks
over 500ms. `hide_board` and `tap_to_advance` remain script-supplied flags.
Timed exercise pages can show a top instruction while the grid remains usable.
Evidence: `000cea80`, `000d02c4`, `000d1124`, `000cda28`.

## Movement and banners

Headings slide from the right, with three staggered lines and the native
overshoot curve (`000c29a8`). Orange word prompts initially grow near the
center, pause, then move to the bottom-left list (`000c8598`). The list and
heading fade while the outgoing board leaves.

Tile changes retain the previous board for presentation. Equal-size animated
boards turn from the old letters to the incoming letters; a dimension change
shrinks the old board before the new board grows. Tile staggering follows
`80 * (height - 1 + column - row)` milliseconds. The current software renderer
projects faces and compresses their width for flips; it does not reproduce the
native GL side faces and depth buffer.

Blue hint arrows and orange player-trace arrows use atlas 446. Orange arrows
have eight separately drawn frames, rather than rotating the rightward art:
right/up-right/up/up-left/left/down-left/down/down-right use
6/12/13/7/8/9/10/11. The hint uses frame 5, rotated. Each arrow is projected onto
the board between adjacent cells. A player's trace covers its matching hint.
Evidence: `000ca9b4`, `000c6db8`, `000c6a48` and tables `0025b7ac`, `002a80cc`.

Banners use font 510, centered as one multiline block at (160,240), with no
dialogue box. Their scale and opacity grow during the entrance. Opacity begins
falling after 60% of the hold period, following `000ccb68`.

| Banner | Text source | Entrance / hold, ms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ready | Resource 13 entry 80 | 700 / 800 |
| Target | Entry 59, formatted with the target | 700 / 1300 |
| Success / failure | Service-96 arguments | 1300 / 700 |
| Time expired | Entry 57 | 1600 / 1000 |
| Result | Entry 81, score and target | 2600 / 2000 |

Successful tutorial pages suppress the ordinary success banner. Banners have
their own lifetime and may continue across a board phase change. Evidence:
`000cba10`, `000c488c`, `000d02c4`, `000d1124`, `000ccb68`, `000c8408`.

## Saved presentation and verification

Save version **7** adds these fields to `engine.word_grid`:

| Field | Schema |
| --- | --- |
| `visual_ms` | Nonnegative active time, capped to the exactly representable integer range; drives decorative movement |
| `board_entry_ms` | 0–2000ms entrance progress; continues across the target banner into phase 2 without restarting the tiles |
| `banner` | Null or `{kind, enter_ms, hold_ms, age_ms}`; kind and timing pairs validated against the table above |
| `transition` | Null or `{problem: GridProblem, board: [byte-character], starts: [cell-index], tutorial: bool, mode: "replace" / "flip" / "shrink"}` |

The existing `tutorial_entry_ms`, `phase_ms`, score and game clocks are also
used for drawing. Rendering and pointer geometry do not advance clocks or draw
random numbers. The desktop freezes these fields while paused or unfocused.
Saving during motion restores the same pixels and retained VM frame.

Version 1–6 saves remain readable. Old grid saves retain their exact board,
selection, score, random state and pending VM call. Missing decorative time
starts at zero and missing banner/outgoing-board state starts null. Their
historical animation frame cannot be recovered from those older saves. Their
tile entrance starts settled (`board_entry_ms=2000`).

Verification includes authored font/layout and save tests, plus optional
player-content rendering and resized-pointer tests. Football Star's sixteen
tutorial records and subsequent 4 x 4 boards have been rendered and visually
inspected locally. These checks do not establish pixel equivalence with an
original device recording. Remaining work includes exact tile side faces,
specular highlights, particle effects, ring pulse curves, flying score deltas,
and all native frame-boundary ordering. Incoming board generation still occurs
at phase-4 entry in the model; native can defer it until exit. None of these
visual changes substitutes a minigame result or resumes the VM without play.
