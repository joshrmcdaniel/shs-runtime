# SHS engine service ABI and dispatcher inventory

Revision: 2026-09-13. Companion to [VM_SPEC.md](VM_SPEC.md) and [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md). The core VM is specified separately because a numeric yield is a call into a game engine, not a display opcode.

This document inventories **every explicit service ID 0–100** in Android 1.0.9 `FUN_0009fe3c`. It includes verified state contracts and unresolved helper calls. Rows marked unresolved are research boundaries, not implemented semantics. Android default cases must not automatically be assumed to have the same meaning in an iOS build.

## 1. Shared calling convention and notation

See [VM yield ABI](VM_SPEC.md#7-yield--host-call-abi) for the complete transition rules. The argument frame is `S[SP-count:SP]`; `a1` is its first word. Arguments are signed 16-bit unless the handler explicitly narrows or interprets their bits differently. Completion removes the entire frame and puts a word in R; the script uses opcode `0x21` to push it. Pending input retains the frame and the already-advanced PC.

- `t(n)` means raw string reference resolution through `FUN_0009f420`.
- `T(n)` means string resolution **plus substitutions** through `FUN_0009f9fc`.
- `bool(a)` is `a != 0`; a byte argument may instead truncate a word.
- “Arguments read” describes accesses visible in the inspected implementation. It is not an assertion that the native reader checks exact arity or accepts every larger frame.
- **C**: current Python host completes this operation, with any stated limitation.
- **P**: Python exposes a recognized pending event; the desktop/session implements the supported input callback.
- **X**: Python leaves the service as `unhandled_yield`, even when a native effect is partly known.

A return of 0 from the C dispatcher does not by itself mean successful completion: pending operations also return 0 to their caller. The pending flags and VM status distinguish those cases. The internal sentinel `0x80000000` is not a script return value.

## 2. Complete dispatcher inventory

All rows derive from `native-yield-dispatcher.c`. Additional evidence is in `native-ui-factory.c`, `native-runtime-helpers.c`, `native-engine-spec-helpers.c`, and `native-playback-helpers.c`. Native addresses are for the binary identified in the EXP spec. C/P describe the implemented subset, not exact reproduction of every native panel or application side effect; see the limits in [RUNTIME.md](RUNTIME.md).

IDs beyond 100 take the inspected dispatcher's default path. Their original meanings and presence in other builds are unknown. The Python host intentionally does not treat unknown IDs as successful no-ops.

## 3. Verified state-service contracts

These contracts define the subset implemented in [engine.py](../src/shs_runtime/engine.py). The implementation checks exact argument counts for these fixed forms. Persistence, rendering, and other noted native side effects are separate from its in-memory state model.

### 3.1 Numeric variables

```text
set_global(key, value)       : services 44, 54; 2 arguments; returns 0
get_global(key)              : services 45, 55; 1 argument; returns stored word or 0
set_owned(owner, key, value) : service 52; 3 arguments; returns 0
get_owned(owner, key)        : service 53; 2 arguments; returns stored word or 0

map_key = (s16(owner) * 65536 + s16(key)) & 0xffffffff
```

Global operations use owner 0. This is signed arithmetic followed by 32-bit wrapping, **not** concatenating two unsigned halves. For owner 1, key -1, the map key is 65535, not 131071. Ordinary setters sign-extend their 16-bit argument into the native 32-bit map. Services 50/51 also access its high bits; ordinary VM getters narrow to 16 bits. Evidence: `FUN_00096474` and `FUN_00095bdc`.

### 3.2 Stored strings and dynamic slots

```text
service 46: (key_ref, value_ref) -> 0
    strings[t(key_ref)] = t(value_ref)

service 47: (key_ref, default_ref, selector) -> handle
    key = t(key_ref)
    value = strings.get(key, "")
    if value is empty:
        value = t(default_ref)
        strings[key] = value
    slot = ~s16(selector)                 # -1 -> 0, ..., -11 -> 10
    dynamic_strings[slot] = value
    return 0x7ff5 + slot
```

These are raw references; substitution is not implicitly applied to key/value arguments. An existing empty value invokes the default just like a missing value. Native default initialization also calls `FUN_0008b2a8`; the Python host does not implement native persistence.

Runtime handles are mutable references to slots, not immutable strings or inverted indices into a static string list. Services can overwrite the slot before a later use. The slot selector in this contract must not be generalized to service 0's distinct formatting convention.

### 3.3 Characters

Service 64 `(character_id, name_ref)` stores `t(name_ref)`. Service 49 adds a third case-conversion flag. With that flag set, its native byte conversion preserves names beginning with `$`; otherwise it changes case at literal spaces using ASCII and specific extended-byte ranges. The current `_format_name()` models those ranges. This is not Unicode title-casing.

Service 72 `(character_id, base_id)` records five art slots natively. For positive bases it stores the base in slot 0 and probes base+1 through base+4; each missing variant falls back to the base. Nonpositive bases are copied across the five slots. Variant numbers are not yet assigned verified expression names. Session supplies resource-bank probes; standalone tracing without a resource bank records base fallbacks. Service 73 returns the stored first art word. Reading an uninitialized character's art is an explicit Python error.

Service 5 stores a signed low byte at the game-state offset given by a1. Service 13 reads that character byte as its default expression. Native helper `FUN_00095c60` selects art slot `expression % 5`. Panel helper `FUN_000ab048` also uses separate bytes at character+200, prior panel state, and relationship properties. NPC relationship icons, cache writes to owned keys 3000/3001, gain/loss sounds, and their animation delays are implemented; see [UI_FIDELITY.md](UI_FIDELITY.md#npc-relationship-indicators). Other expression and panel-lifecycle exceptions remain partial.

### 3.4 Scheduling, defaults, and audio

Service 10 `(script_id, flag)` appends a schedule record; records are consumed in LIFO order after the running VM halts. It returns 0 immediately. The flag's native panel effect is not rendered.

Services 74 and 75 each accept one word and store separate numeric UI defaults. Native consumers can use -2 as a sentinel selecting a stored default; for example the panel setup in service 1 reads `DAT_002af012`. These services are not fade-in/fade-out actions.

Service 79 selects a music request for IDs 8201–8232 and otherwise a sound-effect request. Service 80 stores a music ID and a flag; the flag is retained without assigning a speculative repeat/fade meaning. Service 81 accepts one word and calls the native audio-stop path. The desktop plays the requested music once, plays the latest requested SFX, and stops music when requested. Native fades, looping, all channel semantics, and intermediate same-frame requests remain open.

`FUN_000a92f4(panel, base, variant)` leaves the background unchanged for base -2, hides it for -1, and otherwise uses base+variant for variants 1/2 when that asset exists, falling back to base. Services 11/34 pass `(a2,a1)`, 35 passes `(a3,a2)`, and 86 passes `(a1,a2)`. The frontend retains the static background; native panel existence checks, transitions, and flag-dependent side effects are only partially modeled.

## 4. Presentation and remaining structured arguments

### 4.1 Service 8: title presentation

The positive-title form is `(title_ref, subtitle_ref, asset_id, flag)`. UI factory `FUN_0009fa3c` type `0x10` calls `FUN_000a7758` with substituted title/subtitle and the two numeric fields, attaches the panel, and waits. Negative title references and particular hard-coded title text also trigger Android-specific branches; the Python presentation event does not reproduce those effects.

For the bundled `The_New_Girl.exp`, the verified first presentation in scene 25002 is:

```text
issuing PC: 164       encoded byte offset: 9719
next VM PC: 165       SP: 12       FP: 7
arguments: (42, 49, 1057, 0)
title: The New Girl
subtitle: So it begins...
```

This follows 2,561 executed instructions and one LIFO scene load, not a backward scan of nearby pushes. See `new-girl-start-trace.json`.

### 4.2 Services 13 and 65: dialogue

Service 13's normal argument prefix is `(text_ref, character_id)`. If its first word is negative, the prefix becomes `(mode, text_ref, character_id)`; recognized special modes are -2 and -3, and other negative mode values are normalized in the native path. An optional following word overrides the character's stored expression when it is not -1. The native code resolves raw text, applies mode-specific decorations, looks up character state, sets the panel, and waits.

The -2 prefix surrounds raw text with parentheses; -3 surrounds it with
backticks. `FUN_000a9f84` then applies substitutions at the panel boundary.
The optional expression override is narrowed to a signed byte and clamped at
zero. The event exposes raw and displayed text, visible speaker, requested and
visible character IDs, expression, script prefix, presentation mode and theme.
Service 65 uses `(character_id, text_ref, override)`; its ordinary dialogue path
is exposed, while Android promotional checks and an early return are not
reproduced. The ordinary callback at `0x000b10d8` resumes from panel field +0xb0,
initialized to 0 by display setup. Text reveal and page turns hold the VM's
argument frame. The first tap during a reveal requests its completion; a later
tap turns the page or resumes with 0 after the last page. The session owns
the reveal counter, fast-completion request and portrait/name animation clocks;
rendering never acknowledges this callback.

Dialogue typography is now traced through `FUN_0007cbbc`, `FUN_000a8544`, and
`FUN_000aa0a0`. Ordinary body text uses registry font 5; narrator panel mode 4
uses font 1, and speaker names use Pajama Hip variants. Mode 4 is selected by
service 75's configured character ID, not by the thought prefix or the literal
name "Event". Its name and portrait are hidden. Characters with art use mode 1
when matching service 74, or mode 2 otherwise. Missing art selects mode 3,
clears the visible character/theme and retains the old name object.
Character-owned key 651 selects the ordinary theme. Backticks and semicolons are registered
color controls, with a shared toggle. Kerning affects glyph drawing but not
wrap measurements. The desktop uses native layout-17 rectangles, original box
skins, masked portraits and session-owned pagination. Persistent font-object
state, name exceptions, secondary expressions, decorations and global
transition locks remain partial. Ordinary dialogue now has a source-index
reveal, 300 ms portrait scales/name fades, and a 350 ms page-turn reveal delay.
The scheduler policy and remaining timing paths are specified in
[UI_FIDELITY.md](UI_FIDELITY.md#dialogue-transitions-and-reveal-scheduler).

### 4.3 Services 17/40 and 78: UI-owned data

Services 17 and 40 select UI type 15 and pass substituted title, prompt, and initial text to `FUN_000d4440`, with an additional constant 20 at the caller. Callback `FUN_000d3f5c` copies the entered string (panel +0x9c) to dynamic slot 0, resumes with handle `0x7ff5`, and copies it into host last-input storage +0x54. This callback is implemented. Cancellation, keyboard/widget behavior, and the role of the extra constant still require native analysis; the prototype imposes a 20-character Latin-1 input limit.

Service 78 selects UI type 5. Its factory copies `(text_ref, count, array_word_address)` into a portrait selector. `FUN_000d2238` initializes panel +0x70 to indices 0 through count-1; `FUN_000d1d78` swaps indices and portrait pointers. `FUN_000d2008` handles touch release and a separate confirmation checkmark. `FUN_000d1b48` returns the selected **original index**, not the character ID, and writes UI result cell 0. The first portrait is selected initially. The full frame, input, animation and save contracts are in [STORY_SERVICES.md](STORY_SERVICES.md#portrait-selection-service-78).

### 4.4 Service 0: formatting selector exception

`FUN_0009f5cc(..., 0)` uses argument 1 as a raw format reference when nonnegative and returns slot 0. Otherwise argument 2 is the format and the destination is `1-a1`: -1 selects slot 2, and -9 selects slot 10. The runtime supports the native `%c`, `%d`, `%s` scanner and its aliasing scratch slot 10. See [STORY_SERVICES.md](STORY_SERVICES.md#formatting-and-packed-strings-services-0-24-25-28) for bounds, literal percent handling and memory writes. Service 22 remains separate and unsupported.

### 4.5 Complex UI/minigame frames

Services 71, 94 and 96 now have implemented game models and a separate
[mini-game specification](MINIGAMES.md). It defines all frame fields, nested
record layouts, random streams, clock/input transitions and distinct callbacks.
The models preserve pending frames until actual play completes. Presentation
and some native lifecycle boundaries remain incomplete and are listed there;
implementation tests alone do not establish frame-for-frame equivalence.

### 4.6 Services 1–4: ordinary choices

```text
service 1(title_ref, options_ref, description_ref, timeout_ms,
          timeout_selection, character_id, unused_here, portrait_mode)
    title = T(title_ref)
    options = T(options_ref).split('|')
    description = T(description_ref) if description_ref >= 0 else ""
    character_id = UI default 74 when character_id == -2
    pause until a selection or timeout
    R = s16(selected_zero_based_index)
    result_cells[0] = R

service 2(title_ref, description_ref, timeout_ms,
          timeout_selection, character_id, portrait_mode) -> 0
    begin an incremental choice builder
service 3(option_ref, return_value, enabled) -> 0
    append T(option_ref)
    mapping[index] = index if return_value == -999 else return_value
service 4(shuffle) -> pending
    attach the built panel; clear the builder pointer
    R = mapping[selected_zero_based_index]
    result_cells[0] = R
```

Evidence: `FUN_000b07e8`/`000b04b8` construct the delimited choices and register
zero-based indices; `FUN_000ae740`/`000ae6c8` build custom mappings;
`FUN_000afee8` stores the selected index at panel +0x44; `FUN_000add90` applies
the optional mapping, resumes the VM, and writes host +0x60. The final
pipe-delimited field is empty if its content is whitespace; other fields are
not trimmed by the inspected helper. Disabling an incremental option prevents
player selection. Shuffle requires native PRNG semantics and stays unsupported.

The panel stores initial/remaining time at +0x4c/+0x48. `FUN_000ae4f4` subtracts
elapsed time and uses the configured timeout selection; `FUN_000ad6b4` divides
the time by 1000 for its display widget, establishing milliseconds. Nonpositive
durations disable the timer. The session completes at remaining time zero;
the native comparison is strictly below zero on a frame update. An incremental
choice's timeout selection passes through the same mapping as a clicked option.
An invalid mapped timeout is an explicit runtime error, rather than a native
out-of-bounds read. `portrait_mode` is not an expression: `FUN_000ae5d4` passes
expression zero to `FUN_0009e810`/`FUN_0009e5d8`, with the mode separately.
The art loader flips mode 2 except for theme 3; character property 651 selects
the choice palette. The choice renderer does not reuse the previous dialogue's
expression. See [UI_FIDELITY.md](UI_FIDELITY.md#ordinary-choice-panels) for
the recovered assets, screenshot-based placement and remaining differences.

Rendering, hover, scrolling and opening the host menu leave the pending VM
frame intact. The desktop suspends timer ticks while that menu is open; a
selection still uses the original zero-based index/custom mapping, and saves
retain the existing pending choice and remaining milliseconds.

Relevant decompiler excerpt from `FUN_000ad6b4` (panel +0x4c is the initial
duration, +0x48 the remaining time):

```c
FUN_00082744(DAT_002ae938,
    (*(float *)(param_1 + 0x4c) - *(float *)(param_1 + 0x48)) / 1000.0,
    *(float *)(param_1 + 0x4c) / 1000.0);
```

The supplied New Girl script reaches service 1 at scene 25002 PC 316 with
arguments `(0,949,937,-1,-1,-2,-1,1)`. Choices 0/1 lead to different dialogue
instructions at PCs 336/352. See [RUNTIME.md](RUNTIME.md) for playback and save
verification.

## 5. Remaining work and verification boundary

The main menu is a native application state machine outside this yield ABI.
Its button tags (for example 10002 = Play/Resume) are not VM services.
[MAIN_MENU.md](MAIN_MENU.md) documents states 101/110/111/112, menu commands,
asset bindings and the compatible runtime's local-content lifecycle.

The earlier saved fresh-state corpus trace stopped at recognized service 8 presentations in 37 archives and at unimplemented services 99 (156 archives), 35 (30), 73 (28), 65 (20), or 80 (3) in the other 237. It predates the playback handlers above. No VM error or budget exhaustion occurred before those stops. The new import/session audit covers 271 deduplicated episodes and 974 script records, stopping at 58 presentations, 53 ordinary dialogue screens, 159 service-99 calls, and one service-89 call, with no exception; see `runtime-import-audit.json`. Both audits describe initialization, not exhaustive gameplay coverage.

Ordinary choices and service-71 scores execute distinct actual New Girl branches.
Football and word/picture grids have recovered models, desktop input and saved
random replay. LIFO loading and JSON save migration are tested. Service 99 is a
verified native stub; service 91 now gates execution through the native loading
timer and continues into Football Star's first match. Remaining blockers include
other state/panel services, native save/resource extensions, audio and outstanding
mini-game presentation. The corpus's presence of a service does not prove the
Android helper matches its original iOS semantics.
